# My System Configuration

This is the system configurations I have for my primary use systems like desktops and laptops.

Fair warning, traveler, do not use my configs.  They may serve as examples and inspiration but all NixOS configs are tightly coupled to the systems they configure and pose significant risks when used inappropriately.
